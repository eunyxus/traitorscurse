								<h2>Eraser</h2>
								<p>TRACK 01</p>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Sheeran explained the lyric to Zane Lowe: "I mean the line is friends and family filled with envy but it's not outward envy it's just the odd line here and there. Just being like 'well that must be nice'. Or you'll be somewhere and you'll purposefully want to split a bill just to make a point like you could get it but you're just like today's not the day, we're gonna split the bill and someone will make a comment like 'but you're rich' and you're like ah. That's where that line is coming from.

									Friends and family are meant to be the ones that are f----n there for you and ninety percent of the time they are but every now and then there's the odd comment that just sinks your soul."</p>

									<h2>Castle on the Hill</h2>
									<p>TRACK 02</p>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Ed Sheeran goes back to a younger, wilder time in the wistful video for "Castle on the Hill," which revisits his carefree teenage days. The clip directed by George Belfield -- which dropped on Monday morning (Jan. 23) -- is a pretty faithful recreation of the song's lyrics, which hearken back to the time with Ed rolled in the mountain grass, sped down country lanes with his mates and had his first kiss. 
										Shot on location in Sheeran's hometown of Framlingham, in Suffolk, England, the coming-of-age tale stars an innocent-looking Ed-alike grabbing pints, hanging at bonfires, dancing at clubs, wandering the misty hills, playing pool and just chilling like you do at that age. The shots of teen abandon are intercut with clips of current day Ed, 25, walking thoughtfully along a country lane. </p>

										<h2>Dive</h2>
										<p>TRACK 03</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>The guitar solo on "Dive" is played by one Angelo Mysterioso, who it turns out is one Eric Clapton. The same pseudonym was also credited on an Eric Clapton song, "I Will Be There," on which acoustic guitar and vocals were said to be by Angelo Mysterioso. That feature was originally rumored to be George Harrison, but later speculation centered on Ed Sheeran after they both performed the song together in Japan in 2016. 

											Sheeran has said in the past that the guitar legend is a fan of his music. "I've had Eric Clapton come to my house for dinner," he told Radio x. "I've gone to his house for dinner and he tells me that he likes my music."</p>

											<h2>Shape Of You</h2>
											<p>TRACK 04</p>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>The song was originally written at a writing camp with Rihanna in mind, but when Sheeran and the other songwriters included a reference to Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, they decided not to send the song to the Caribbean star. Sheeran recalled on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast Show: "I started writing lyrics like 'putting Van the Man on the juke box' and thought 'she’s not really going to sing that.' We decided halfway through that this would work for me.”

												Sheeran later revealed that Little Mix were in the running to record the tune too. Speaking with BeBox, Sheeran said. "Do you know what, the actual story is, we started it for Little Mix originally, and then halfway through I was like, 'Actually this sounds like it could be good for Rihanna'.
												And then more of the way through we were like, 'Yeah, this is actually pretty good. We should keep it.'"</p>

												<h2>Perfect</h2>
												<p>TRACK 05</p>
											</header>
											<div class="content">
												<p>Ed Sheeran wrote this waltz-time love song for his girlfriend Cherry Seaborn, who is an old school friend. After writing it he had no idea whether or not she really likes the track. "I just recorded it and sent it because she was living in New York at the time so I didn't see her reaction," he told BBC Radio 2. "I think she liked it, it's a good'un (good one)." "Thinking Out Loud" was co-written with folk singer Amy Wadge and Sheeran told the BBC that he wants the biggest song of his career just to have his name on the credits. "I need to write the best love song of my career," he said, "and I need to do it one hundred percent me so everyone will listen to it and be like 'oh f--k, no, he actually can do it.'"</p>

												<h2>Galway Girl</h2>
												<p>TRACK 06</p>
											</header>
											<div class="content">
												<p>Ed Sheeran sings on this folk-pop song about falling for an Irish girl. The track is the result of him inviting Norther Irish trad-folk band Beoga to his home recording studio for a week. Sheeran explained to The Irish Times: 

													"It was based on the fiddle player in Beoga, Niamh [Dunne]. She's married to an Irishman, a friend of mine. I had the band in my house for an extra day so I was like, 'what can I write about? She plays the fiddle in an Irish band... right, cool, let's write a song about that.' She inspired the first line but the rest of the song isn't about anyone, I just made up a story."</p>

													<p>Ed Sheeran sings on this breakup ballad about seeing his girl with another man. However this not a bitter diss at an ex. He told Spotify: 

														"I've definitely got to a point in my life where I'm friends with all my ex-girlfriends now, like we're all cool and it's very much like I'm really happy that you're happy and with someone that you love, and they are really happy that I'm happy and with someone and there's a grown up element to it."</p>

														<p>Ed Sheeran takes aim at his former girlfriiend's new boyfriend on this aggressive breakup song, suggesting his ex has made poor choices as she still has feelings for him.

															I don't wanna know about your new man
															'Cause if it was meant to be
															You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
															'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

															Speaking with Zane Lowe on his Beats 1 show, Sheeran explained that he isn't talking about an actual boyfriend of his ex but the stereotype of the guys that she likes, or at least she thinks she likes.</p>

															<h2>Hearts Don't Break Around Here</h2>

														</header>
														<div class="content">
															<p>Ed Sheeran has known his girlfriend Cherry Seaborn since they both attended Thomas Mills High School in Framlington, Suffolk. Their friendship turned into a relationship in 2015. During this sweet acoustic song, Sheeran sings of his love for his "sweetest" girl.

																She is the sweetest thing that I know
																Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
																Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
																Took my heart upon a one way trip
																Guess she went wandering off with it

																Speaking to Today's Richard Wilkins, Sheeran talked how being 'loved up' with Cherry was a calming force in his hectic life. "Everything's just a lot easier," the singer said. "That side of my life is meant to be the part that chills you out, and it definitely is."</p>

																<h2>What Do I Know?</h2>
																<p>TRACK 10</p>
															</header>
															<div class="content">
																<p>Ed Sheeran is not known as a political singer; he just wants to play songs. As a singer-songwriter without an university education he feels that many would see him as unqualified to pontificate about the world's problems. However, here he joins those who want to change the world peacefully, by suggesting that love has a powerful effect on the world. 

																	I'm just a boy with a one-man show
																	No university, no degree, but lord knows
																	Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
																	And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
																	While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
																	Sing, love could change the world in a moment
																	But what do I know?

																	Sheeran sarcastically asks why should people listen to him over those with an education.</p>
